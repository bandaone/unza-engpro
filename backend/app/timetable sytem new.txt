1. System Structure

A. Departmental (HOD) Portal
Each department has its own secure login.
HODs (or delegates) enter and manage:
Courses (with all details: code, hours, labs, equipment, year, etc.)
Groups (with size, year, department, etc.)
Lecturers (with availability, expertise, etc.)
Course-to-group and lecturer assignments
Lab/equipment needs

B. Central Coordinator Portal
Coordinator manages:
Global resources (venues, labs, special rooms)
Global constraints (university-wide policies, holidays, etc.)
Aggregates all departmental data for timetable generation
Reviews and resolves cross-departmental conflicts

2. Data Flow & Validation
A. Departmental Data Entry & Validation
Real-time validation: As HODs enter data, the system checks for:
Missing or inconsistent fields
Overlapping lecturer assignments within the department
Group hour overloads
Lab/equipment overbooking within the department
Immediate feedback: HODs see and fix issues before submitting.

B. Data Aggregation & Global Validation
All department data is merged.
Automated global checks:
Room/lab overbooking across all departments
Lecturer double-booking across departments
Total demand vs. available slots/rooms
Equipment/resource conflicts
Conflict dashboard: Coordinator sees all unresolved issues.

3. Error/Issue Resolution Workflow
Step	Actor	Action/Tool
Data entry	HOD	Department portal (web UI, real-time checks)
Dept. validation	System	Automated, immediate feedback in UI
Dept. correction	HOD	Fixes flagged issues before submission
Data aggregation	System	Merges all department data
Global validation	System	Automated, cross-department checks
Conflict review	Coordinator	Dashboard (web UI) for all global issues
Issue assignment	Coordinator	Assigns issues to relevant HODs for resolution
Final correction	HOD/Coord.	Departments/coordinator fix and resubmit
Timetable run	Coordinator	Runs solver (e.g., Google OR-Tools, Gurobi)
Result review	All	Review, minor manual tweaks if needed

4. Best-in-Class Tools
Backend: Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy
Frontend: React or Vue.js for responsive, real-time UI
Solver: Google OR-Tools (open-source, world-class), or Gurobi/CPLEX for very large/complex cases
Validation: Python (pydantic, custom logic), SQL queries, real-time feedback in UI
Authentication: OAuth2, SSO, or university LDAP integration
Deployment: Docker, Docker Compose, cloud-ready (AWS, Azure, GCP)
Monitoring: Sentry (error tracking), Prometheus/Grafana (metrics)

5. Key Features for Clean Data and Success
Role-based access: HODs see only their department; coordinator sees all.
Audit trail: All changes are logged (who, what, when).
Iterative feedback: Issues are flagged early and often, not just at the end.
Conflict resolution: System suggests solutions (e.g., move lab, split group).
Export/import: CSV/Excel support for bulk edits if needed.

6. Sample Workflow
HOD logs in, enters/updates all department data.
System flags any issues (missing info, double-booked lecturer, etc.).
HOD fixes issues and submits.
Coordinator aggregates all data, runs global validation.
System flags cross-department issues (e.g., two departments want the same lab at the same time).
Coordinator assigns issues back to departments or resolves directly.
Once all issues are cleared, coordinator runs the solver.
Timetable is generated and published; departments review and request minor tweaks if needed.
